**Caries Inc: Game Design**

**Game Overview:**
Caries Inc is a strategic simulation game set within the confines of a human mouth. Instead of spreading a pathogen across the globe, players aim to spread and evolve destructive bacteria to ultimately cause severe tooth decay. The objective is to destroy all the teeth in the mouth by overcoming the owner's dental hygiene practices.

**Main Game Mechanics:**

1. **Bacteria Selection**:

   - Players begin by selecting a type of bacteria, each with unique characteristics and challenges. Examples include Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus, and Actinomyces.

2. **Transmission Evolution**:

   - Players evolve their bacteria's transmission methods to increase their spread throughout the mouth. Options include:
     - **Saliva Spread**: Increases the spread through saliva contact.
     - **Food Residue**: Utilizes leftover food particles to enhance bacterial growth.
     - **Plaque Formation**: Develops biofilms that adhere to teeth surfaces, promoting faster spread.

3. **Symptom Evolution**:

   - Players evolve symptoms to cause more damage to the teeth and gums:
     - **Enamel Erosion**: Increases the rate at which the enamel is worn down.
     - **Cavity Formation**: Promotes the development of cavities, leading to deeper tooth damage.
     - **Gum Recession**: Causes gums to recede, exposing more of the tooth to bacterial attack.

4. **Ability Evolution**:

   - Players evolve abilities to help their bacteria survive and thrive in the mouth environment:
     - **Acid Resistance**: Enhances bacteria's ability to survive acidic environments.
     - **Biofilm Fortification**: Strengthens the protective layer around colonies.
     - **Antibiotic Resistance**: Increases resistance to treatments like mouthwash and antibiotics.

5. **Resource Points (Plaque Points)**:

   - Players earn Plaque Points by causing damage to teeth and gums. These points are used to evolve transmission methods, symptoms, and abilities.

6. **Spread and Infection**:

   - The bacteria spread from tooth to tooth through various means such as saliva, food particles, and poor oral hygiene practices. Players must strategically manage the spread to ensure maximum infection before being detected.

7. **Oral Hygiene Efforts**:

   - As the bacteria cause more damage, the teeth owner will start implementing countermeasures like brushing, flossing, mouthwash, and dental visits. Players must monitor and counteract these efforts by evolving abilities that reduce the effectiveness of these countermeasures.

8. **Strategic Decision-Making**:

   - Players must balance infectivity, severity, and stealth to ensure the bacteria spread widely before triggering aggressive hygiene measures from the teeth owner.

9. **Environmental Adaptation**:

   - Players need to adapt their bacteria to different conditions within the mouth, such as varying pH levels, the presence of saliva, and the impact of different foods and drinks.

10. **In-Game Events**:

- Random events can influence the game, such as changes in diet, sudden improvements or lapses in oral hygiene, and visits to the dentist. These events can either hinder or help the spread of the bacteria.

11. **Victory Conditions**:

- The game is won if the player successfully infects and destroys all the teeth in the mouth. The game is lost if the teeth owner successfully implements a cure or dental hygiene routine that eradicates the bacteria.

**Additional Features:**

- **Diet Choices**: Players can induce poor diet habits (e.g., high sugar intake) to speed up bacteria spread and tooth decay.
- **Hygiene Neglect**: Players can influence the teeth owner to neglect dental care, making it easier for bacteria to thrive.
- **Dentist Visits**: Introduce mini-games or challenges where players must counteract the effects of dental treatments and cleanings.
- **Progression System**: Unlock new bacteria types, transmission methods, and abilities as players progress through different levels of tooth decay.

**Visual and Audio Design:**

- **Visuals**: Detailed and realistic graphics of the inside of a mouth, showcasing teeth, gums, bacteria, and the effects of decay.
- **Audio**: Immersive sound effects representing the sounds of a dental environment, such as brushing, mouthwash gargles, and the ominous sounds of tooth decay.

**Target Audience:**

- Fans of strategy and simulation games, especially those who enjoyed Plague Inc.
- Individuals interested in dental health and the mechanics of oral hygiene.
- Players looking for a unique and educational twist on the strategy genre.

By integrating these mechanics and features, Caries Inc will provide a compelling and educational gaming experience that challenges players to think strategically about dental health and hygiene.
